What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Initialzing a repository is the first step in starting Git's history 
    tracking. Doing so, all the files in the directory of the repository
    are grouped into a repository which can then be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area contains only the file that are to be added in a 
    commit whereas the working directory contains both the files in the
    staging area and also those not in staging area i.e. it contains all
    of the files in the repository directory. Staging area allows complete 
    control over which files to be added in a commit allowing selection of 
    either on, all or any number of files.
