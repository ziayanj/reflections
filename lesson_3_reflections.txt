  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When the repository is to be shared with other people as using a remote repository 
    on GitHub allows everyone to access, share and collaborate on everything easily.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    The remote repository might have been updated by someone else and in this case you may
    not always want to pull those changes to your local repository.
