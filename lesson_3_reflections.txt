  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When the repository is to be shared with other people as using a remote repository 
    on GitHub allows everyone to access, share and collaborate on everything easily.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    The remote repository might have been updated by someone else and in this case you may
    not always want to pull those changes to your local repository. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork is basically creating a copy of a GitHub repository on your own GitHub account, it 
    only exists on the GitHub's servers and cloning is what can be used to make a copy of it,
    or, more generally, any repository, on your computer as a local repository. Cloning also
    sets a remote to the repository the cloning was done from. Branches are the different 
    paths or well, branches, within a repository generally made to keep different versions 
    of something separate while also being present simultaneously.
    Forks are used when the original author of the repository does not want his repository
    to be changed but you want to make some changes in it, you can fork it to your GitHub
    account. Cloning is used when the repository requires changing from your computer locally.
    Branches are generally used when an experimental feature or a developing idea is to be
    implemented as it allows doing so keeping the original version intact and operational.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    It allows solving conflicts more easily as you can locally run commands like git log 
    and git diff to see what changes were introduced both in the local and the remote 
    repository and then resolve those conflicts without needing an internet connection to
    keep you connected to the remote.
